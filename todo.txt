Starling usability check.

To enable mobile device targeting, we'll try different ways (Unity 3D, pure Actionscript, stage3D wih Starling)

This repository will focus research over starling possibility. Using some basic assets, this prototype will focus on: 
- benchmark the 3D display api on an Android device (lack of iOs device) 
- use the screen touch controls, for click and drag'n drop operation
- reference all the difference between web application, and mobile AIR application
